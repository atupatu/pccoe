# PII Security System

## Overview
The PII Security System is a comprehensive solution designed for government websites and applications, providing advanced cybersecurity features with a focus on personally identifiable information (PII) detection and audio redaction. Built as both a React Native mobile application and a web platform, this system offers seamless integration with existing government digital infrastructure.

## Key Features

### üîí PII Detection & Protection
- **Advanced Document Scanning**: Automatically identifies PII in documents including names, addresses, ID numbers, and biometric identifiers
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes documents on-the-fly to flag sensitive information as it's uploaded or entered
- **Custom PII Rules**: Configurable rules for different document types and government departments
- **Domicile Certificate Processing**: Specialized handling for domicile certificates and similar government documents

### üîä Audio Redaction
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts audio files to text for PII analysis
- **Automated Redaction**: Identifies and removes sensitive information from audio recordings
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple audio files simultaneously
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable thresholds for PII detection in audio

### üåê Integration Capabilities
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API architecture for easy integration with existing systems
- **Plug-and-Play Deployment**: Can be implemented on top of any government website or application
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Functions across browsers, operating systems, and mobile devices
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Minimal performance impact on host applications

### üìä Security Analytics
- **PII Exposure Dashboard**: Visual reporting of PII detection metrics
- **Threat Intelligence**: Identifies potential data breach vulnerabilities
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all system activities
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates reports for regulatory requirements

### üîÑ Cross-Platform Experience
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Built with Vue.js for a seamless browser experience
- **Mobile Application**: React Native app with Expo for iOS and Android with feature parity to web version
- **Offline Capabilities**: Core functionality available without internet connection
- **Synchronized Experience**: Consistent user experience across all platforms

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/pii-security-system.git
   
   # Install dependencies
   cd pii-security-system
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration**:
   - Configure database connections in `config.json`
   - Set up API keys in `.env` file (see `.env.example`)
   - Adjust PII detection rules in `pii_rules.json`

3. **Running the Application**:
   ```bash
   # Start backend services
   cd backend
   python app.py  # Runs the Guardian Analyzer
   
   # Start FileBrowser (in a separate terminal)
   filebrowser -r /path/to/files -p 8080
   
   # Start Vue.js web interface (in a separate terminal)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Build and run mobile app with Expo
   cd mobile
   expo start
   # Then press 'a' for Android or 'i' for iOS
   ```

4. **Mobile App Development with Expo**:
   ```bash
   # Install Expo CLI globally
   npm install -g expo-cli
   
   # Build for production
   expo build:android
   expo build:ios
   ```

5. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
   - See `docs/integration_guide.md` for detailed instructions
   - Use the provided REST API endpoints in `docs/api_reference.md`
   - Sample integration code available in `examples/` directory

## System Requirements

### Backend Server
- Python 3.8+
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 4 CPU cores minimum
- 50GB storage for application and logs

### FileBrowser
- Port 8080 must be available (configurable)
- Read/write permissions on target directories

### Frontend Development
- Node.js 14+
- npm 6+
- Port 3000 for development server

### Mobile Development
- Expo SDK 44+
- Android Studio / Xcode for native builds

## Security Considerations

- All PII processing occurs on-premises to maintain data sovereignty
- No sensitive information is transmitted to external services
- Regular security audits and penetration testing are recommended
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks by design
