# PII Security System

## Overview
The PII Security System is a comprehensive solution designed for government websites and applications, providing advanced cybersecurity features with a focus on personally identifiable information (PII) detection and audio redaction. Built as both a Vue.js web platform and a React Native mobile application, this system integrates seamlessly with existing government digital infrastructure.

## Key Features

### üîí PII Detection & Protection
- **Advanced Document Scanning**: Automatically identifies PII in documents, including names, addresses, ID numbers, and biometric identifiers.
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes documents on-the-fly to flag sensitive information as it's uploaded or entered.
- **Custom PII Rules**: Configurable rules for different document types and government departments.
- **Domicile Certificate Processing**: Specialized handling for domicile certificates and similar government documents.

### üîä Audio Redaction
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts audio files to text for PII analysis.
- **Automated Redaction**: Identifies and removes sensitive information from audio recordings.
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple audio files simultaneously.
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable thresholds for PII detection in audio.

### üåê Integration Capabilities
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API architecture for easy integration with existing systems.
- **Plug-and-Play Deployment**: Can be implemented on top of any government website or application.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Functions across browsers, operating systems, and mobile devices.
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Minimal performance impact on host applications.

### üìä Security Analytics
- **PII Exposure Dashboard**: Visual reporting of PII detection metrics.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Identifies potential data breach vulnerabilities.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all system activities.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates reports for regulatory requirements.

### üîÑ Cross-Platform Experience
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Built with Vue.js for a seamless browser experience.
- **Mobile Application**: React Native app with Expo for iOS and Android with feature parity to web version.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Core functionality available without an internet connection.
- **Synchronized Experience**: Consistent user experience across all platforms.

## Getting Started

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/atupatu/pccoe.git

# Install dependencies
cd pii-security-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd vue_frontend
npm install
```

### **Configuration**
- Configure database connections in `config.json`
- Set up API keys in `.env` file (see `.env.example`)
- Adjust PII detection rules in `pii_rules.json`

### **Running the Application**
```bash
# Start backend services
cd backend
python app.py  # Runs the Guardian Analyzer

# Start FileBrowser (in a separate terminal)
filebrowser -r /path/to/files -p 8080

# Start Vue.js web interface
cd vue_frontend
npm run dev
```

### **Mobile App Development with Expo**
```bash
# Install Expo CLI globally
npm install -g expo-cli

# Build for production
expo build:android
expo build:ios
```

### **Integration with Existing Systems**
- See `docs/integration_guide.md` for detailed instructions.
- Use the provided REST API endpoints in `docs/api_reference.md`.
- Sample integration code available in the `examples/` directory.

## System Requirements

### **Backend Server**
- Python 3.8+
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 4 CPU cores minimum
- 50GB storage for application and logs

### **FileBrowser**
- Port `8080` must be available (configurable).
- Read/write permissions on target directories.

### **Frontend Development**
- Node.js 14+

### **Mobile Development**
- Expo SDK 44+

## Security Considerations
- All PII processing occurs on-premises to maintain data sovereignty.
- No sensitive information is transmitted to external services.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing are recommended.
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks by design.
